# Product Requirements Document (PRD): bilge

## Overview
Bilge is a cross-platform Go toolkit for reclaiming disk space by identifying and cleaning developer caches and repository metadata. The unified command and Homebrew cask are both named `bilge`; the macOS, Linux, and Windows platform tasks are `bilge-macos`, `bilge-linux`, and `bilge-windows`.

## Project Goals
- Safety first (no direct deletions where possible, use official tool commands)
- Transparent dry-run by default
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL)
- Extensible via YAML configuration
- Transparent size reporting
- Selective filtering for targeted operations
- JSON output for automation/CI integration
- A single `bilge` executable that runs the full platform-appropriate cleanup or selected cleanup tasks
- The public command, release archive prefix, installer selection, and Homebrew cask use the name `bilge` beginning with v2.1.0.
- Configuration stored under the XDG Base Directory Specification on Unix-like systems, honoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`

## Unified `bilge` CLI

### Overview
Ship one unified `bilge` command for macOS, Linux, and Windows. The release bundles its task executables in the same install directory; users invoke `bilge` for `scan`, `clean`, and named-tool commands. The command locates bundled tools beside itself, and does not require users to install Go or put each tool on `PATH`.

### Configuration
- The unified config is stored at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bilge-pump/config.yaml` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set; otherwise use the platform user config directory (`~/.config/bilge-pump/config.yaml` on Unix and the OS config directory on Windows).
- `--config` overrides the default path.
- Existing tool configs remain readable at their XDG-aware per-tool paths, and `git-cleaner` gains config support for its default scan path.
- A first run works with built-in sensible defaults; `--init` writes a customizable config.
- A local `make bilge` build places the launcher and all host-platform task executables together under `build/`.
- Cross-build cleaner targets write into OS/architecture-specific subdirectories and do not overwrite the native bundle under `build/`.
- Selecting `bilge` in `install.sh` installs the launcher and all task executables it needs; selecting a standalone cleaner still installs only that tool.
- Legacy component executables use their built-in starter config when their default XDG/platform config is absent; an explicitly supplied missing `--config` path remains an error.
- Explicit missing component configs remain errors even when the supplied path happens to equal that tool's default config path.
- The unified CLI consumes orchestration flags itself, routes `--yes` only to project cache cleanup, and rejects task-specific arguments that are invalid for any selected task before starting a clean operation.
- Boolean orchestration flags honor explicit true/false values; invalid values fail before any child process starts.
- Missing explicitly named config files are errors in every tool; built-in defaults apply only when the default config path was implicit.
- The unified command accepts only known bundled task names and never launches arbitrary executables from configuration.
- Windows release archives are ZIP files matching `install.ps1`; macOS and Linux retain tar.gz archives.

### CLI and behavior
- `bilge scan` reports findings across tasks without changing files.
- `bilge clean --all` runs platform-appropriate cleanup tasks; `bilge clean <task>` or `bilge <task>` selects one task.
- Individual legacy tools remain available for compatibility.
- One shared JSON report schema and exit-code convention apply to unified orchestration.
- `bilge scan --json` emits a valid JSON envelope with each selected task's structured report; task progress stays on stderr.
- Platform builds cover macOS, Linux, and Windows (amd64 and arm64 where supported).
- Windows batch-based cleanup commands preserve executable paths and argument boundaries containing spaces and shell metacharacters; values containing percent signs are rejected because `cmd.exe` expands them before batch execution.
- Cleanup remains dry-run by default; destructive tasks require explicit `clean` intent and task-level safety controls.
- Project cache deletion skips paths with tracked files or paths that Git does not mark ignored unless the user supplies the explicit `--unsafe-clean` override.
- Git safety checks discover the repository from each cache directory, including projects nested under non-repository grouping directories.
- Platform cleaner scans list each selected target and its planned cleanup commands, including targets such as Docker that have no filesystem paths.
- Platform cleaner rejects unknown, empty, and mixed-invalid `--targets` selections before scanning or running cleanup commands.
- Platform cleaner scans report filesystem inspection failures and return a partial-failure exit code; nonexistent optional cache paths are omitted without error.
- macOS Homebrew post-install handling removes quarantine from the unified launcher as well as its bundled task executables.
- Docker cleanup preserves named volumes by default; Android SDK updates and commands that install software or start services are excluded from cleanup defaults.

## bilge-macos

### Overview
A safe, config-driven Go CLI for macOS that frees disk space using **official tool commands** (Docker, npm/yarn/pnpm, Go, Maven, Brew, and many more) instead of deleting files directly.

### Goals
- Safety first (no direct deletions)
- Transparent dry-run by default
- Extensible via YAML
- Transparent size reporting
- Target filtering for selective operations
- Intelligent tool requirement checking
- Installation guidance for missing tools

### Key Features

#### CLI Flags
- `--init` writes starter config to `~/.config/bilge-macos/config.yaml`
- `--force` forces overwrite of existing config when used with `--init`
- `--config` specifies path to YAML config (defaults to `~/.config/bilge-macos/config.yaml`)
- `--clean` executes cleanup commands (default: dry-run mode)
- `--targets` filters targets to scan/clean (comma-separated or "all")
- `--details` shows detailed per-directory information
- `--json` outputs structured JSON for automation/CI
- `--list-targets` lists all available targets in the config
- `--docker-prune` injects Docker prune commands at runtime
- `--check-tools` checks if required tools are installed and exits (can be combined with `--targets`)

#### Configuration Structure
```yaml
version: 1
options:
  dockerPruneByDefault: false
targets:
  - name: docker
    enabled: true
    notes: "Report Docker.raw size; optionally run prunes."
    paths: ["~/Library/Caches/docker/*", ...]  # measured for size
    cmds: [["docker", "builder", "prune", "-af"], ...]  # executed when --clean
    tools:  # required tools for this target
      - name: docker
        version: "24.0"  # optional: minimum version
        installCmd: "brew install --cask docker"  # installation command
        installNotes: "Optional installation notes"
        checkPath: "~/.docker/config"  # optional: check specific file path instead of PATH
```

- **rvm** - RVM installed rubies and archives (informational/has cleanup)
- **dropbox** - Dropbox metadata and state (informational only)
- **cursor** - Cursor editor state and cache (informational)

#### Path Expansion
- Supports `~` for home directory
- Expands environment variables (`$VAR`)
- Supports `$(brew --cache)` expansion
- Glob patterns for flexible matching
- Command substitutions are whitelist-only for safety; currently only `brew --cache` is supported. Other substitutions (e.g., `$(docker ...)`) are rejected.

#### Reporting Features
- Size measurement in bytes with human-readable output
- Item count tracking
- Latest modification time per path
- Command availability detection
- JSON output for programmatic processing
- Warnings for glob errors
- Before/after comparison when `--clean` is used
- Total space freed calculation
- Docker usage is measured via `docker system df` (JSON/template parsing), not by reading `Docker.raw` directly

### Behavior
1. **Dry-run by default** - Reports sizes without making changes
2. **Tool requirement checking** - Checks if required tools are installed before running commands
3. **Size scanning** - Measures all configured paths before any cleanup
4. **Command execution** - Runs official tool CLI commands when `--clean` is set
5. **Target filtering** - Process specific targets with `--targets` flag
6. **Docker prune injection** - Adds prune commands when configured/flagged
7. **Auto-confirm prompts** - Automatically sends 'y' to interactive prompts when running commands
8. **Re-scan after cleanup** - Shows before/after sizes and freed space when `--clean` is used

#### Tool Management
- Before executing commands, the app checks if required tools (specified in `tools` array) are installed
- If a tool is missing, a warning is shown with installation guidance
- Installation commands default to `brew install` if Homebrew is available
- Version checking: When a version is specified, the app performs a basic `--version` contains check to verify presence; it does not perform full semantic version comparison
- Commands are marked as "not found" when their prerequisite tools are missing
- Custom path checking: If `checkPath` is specified, the app checks for the existence of that file instead of using PATH lookup
- Tool status is displayed with ✓ for installed tools and ✗ for missing tools

#### Check Tools Flag
The `--check-tools` flag provides a quick way to verify tool requirements:
- Shows ✓ for installed tools with version info (if available)
- Shows ✗ for missing tools with installation commands
- Lists which targets require each tool
- Respects `--targets` flag to check tools for specific targets only
- Exits with status 0 (all OK) or 1 (some missing) - useful for CI/CD scripts

#### List Targets Flag
The `--list-targets` flag shows all available targets:
- Lists all targets from the config file
- Shows [ENABLED] or [DISABLED] status for each target
- Displays notes for each target
- Useful for discovering available cleanup options

#### JSON Mode Behavior
- When `--json` is provided, the app outputs the initial scan results (including totals and warnings) and exits. Cleanup is not performed even if `--clean` is also set.

### Out of Scope
- Windows/Linux paths (future)
- Direct file deletion (unsafe)
- Chrome deletion automation (no stable CLI)
- Interactive prompts (auto-confirmed with 'y')

### Future Enhancements
- TUI interface
- Homebrew cask
- Scheduled runs
- CI/CD integration examples
- Windows/Linux support

---

## dev-cache

### Overview
A cross-platform Go CLI tool that scans source code directories to find and optionally delete local project cache directories (like `node_modules`, `build`, `dist`, `.venv`, etc.) across multiple programming languages.

### Goals
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL)
- Multi-language cache detection
- Configurable scanning depth and patterns
- Safe deletion with confirmation prompts
- Detailed reporting by language and project

### Key Features

#### CLI Flags
- `--init` creates starter config file and exits
- `--force` forces overwrite of existing config (use with --init)
- `--config PATH` specifies path to YAML config (default: `~/.config/dev-cache/config.yaml`)
- `--scan PATH` directory to scan (overrides config default)
- `--depth N` max scan depth (overrides config default, 0 = use config)
- `--languages LIST` comma-separated list of languages to scan (e.g., `node,python,go`)
- `--unsafe-clean` allow cleanup of cache paths that Git does not mark ignored (unsafe override)
- `--exclude PATHS` comma-separated project paths to exclude from scanning and cleanup
- `--include-only PATHS` comma-separated project paths to scan; when set, this whitelist takes precedence over `excludePaths`
- `--min-age DURATION` only include caches at least this old (for example, `30d`)
- `--max-age DURATION` only include caches no older than this (for example, `7d`)
- `--clean` deletes found cache directories
- `--yes` skips confirmation prompt for cleanup
- `--json` outputs results as JSON
- `--details` shows detailed per-project breakdown

#### Configuration Structure
```yaml
version: 1
options:
  defaultScanPath: ~/src
  maxDepth: 1  # How many levels deep to scan
  excludePaths: []
  includeOnly: []
  minAge: ""
  maxAge: ""

languages:
  - name: node
    enabled: true
    patterns:
      - node_modules
      - .npm
      - .yarn
      - .pnpm-store

  - name: python
    enabled: true
    patterns:
      - .venv
      - venv
      - __pycache__
      - .pytest_cache
      - .mypy_cache
```

#### Supported Languages
- **Node.js**: `node_modules`, `.npm`, `.yarn`, `.pnpm-store`
- **Python**: `.venv`, `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.tox`
- **Go**: `vendor`
- **Rust**: `target`
- **Java/Kotlin**: `target`, `.gradle`, `build`
- **Next.js**: `.next`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `.cache`
- **Vue/Nuxt**: `.nuxt`, `dist`, `build`, `out`, `.cache`, `.parcel-cache`
- **PHP**: `vendor`
- **Ruby**: `vendor/bundle`
- **C#/.NET**: `bin`, `obj`
- **C/C++**: `build`, `cmake-build-*` (wildcard supported)
- **Flutter/Dart**: `.dart_tool`

#### Pattern Matching
- **Exact match**: `node_modules` matches only `node_modules`
- **Wildcard prefix**: `cmake-build-*` matches `cmake-build-debug`, `cmake-build-release`, etc.

#### Path and Age Filters
- `excludePaths` and `includeOnly` accept exact paths, descendant paths, and path globs; relative patterns resolve from the process working directory. Filters apply throughout the scan tree so nested projects can be selected.
- CLI `--exclude`, `--include-only`, `--min-age`, and `--max-age` values override their corresponding config values.
- When `includeOnly` is configured, it acts as a whitelist and takes precedence over `excludePaths`; otherwise matching excluded roots are skipped.
- Age filters use the newest file modification time within each cache directory. `minAge` keeps caches at least that old; `maxAge` keeps caches no older than that. If both are set, a cache must satisfy both.
- When an age filter is active and a cache's modification time cannot be determined, the cache is omitted from results and cleanup. A cache directory excluded by age is not traversed for nested findings.
- If an excluded path is inside a cache directory, the enclosing cache is omitted from scan results and cleanup because removing it would delete the excluded path.
- Path and age filters apply to both scans and cleanup.

#### Reporting Features
- Summary mode (default): Groups findings by language with totals
- Detailed mode (`--details`): Shows each cache directory found with project path, cache type, language, size, and item count
- JSON output for programmatic processing
- Size measurement in bytes with human-readable output
- Item count tracking per directory

### Behavior
1. **Dry-run by default** - Reports cache directories without deleting files
2. **Recursive scanning** - Walks through directory tree looking for cache patterns
3. **Language filtering** - Can target specific languages via `--languages` flag
4. **Depth control** - Configurable maximum scan depth to limit traversal
5. **Safe deletion** - Requires explicit `--clean` flag with confirmation prompt (unless `--yes` is used)
6. **Error handling** - Deletion errors are logged and reported, but don't stop the process

### Platform Support
- **macOS**: Native support (amd64 and arm64)
- **Linux**: Full support (amd64 and arm64)
- **Windows WSL**: Full support through Linux compatibility

All paths use `filepath.Join()` for cross-platform compatibility. Home directory expansion (`~`) works on all platforms via `os.UserHomeDir()`.

### Safety Considerations
- **Dry-run by default**: The tool never deletes files unless `--clean` is explicitly provided
- **Confirmation prompt**: When using `--clean`, you must confirm the deletion (unless `--yes` is used)
- **Shows what will be deleted**: The tool displays all findings before asking for confirmation
- **Error handling**: Deletion errors are logged and reported, but don't stop the process
- **Git-aware cleanup**: Cleanup skips caches containing tracked files, nested Git repositories, or paths not ignored by Git. `--unsafe-clean` is the explicit override.

### Future Enhancements
- Backup before deletion
- TUI interface

## git-cleaner

### Overview
A cross-platform Go CLI tool that scans directories for `.git` directories, reports their sizes, and optionally optimizes repositories using `git gc`.

### Goals
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows WSL)
- Efficient repository discovery
- Safe optimization using official Git commands
- Clear reporting of disk savings

### Key Features

#### CLI Flags
- `--scan PATH` directory to scan for .git directories (required)
- `--clean` runs `git gc` in each repository and shows disk savings

#### Reporting Features
- Table output showing repository paths and `.git` directory sizes
- Item count tracking per repository
- Before/after comparison when `--clean` is used
- Total disk savings calculation with percentage

### Behavior
1. **Recursive scanning** - Walks through directory tree looking for `.git` directories
2. **Size calculation** - Calculates total size by walking through all files in each `.git` directory
3. **Optimization** (with `--clean`) - Runs `git gc` in each repository's parent directory
4. **Rescan after optimization** - After optimization, rescans to calculate disk space saved

### Platform Support
- **macOS**: Native support (amd64 and arm64)
- **Linux**: Full support (amd64 and arm64)
- **Windows WSL**: Full support through Linux compatibility

All paths use `filepath.Join()` for cross-platform compatibility. Home directory expansion (`~`) works on all platforms via `os.UserHomeDir()`.

### Requirements
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git must be installed and available in PATH (for `--clean` functionality)

### Safety Considerations
- Uses official `git gc` command for optimization (safe)
- Only optimizes Git repositories, never deletes them
- Shows clear before/after comparison

### Future Enhancements
- Configuration file support for default scan paths
- Filtering by repository size (only optimize large repos)
- Filtering by last activity date
- Integration with git worktree detection
- Support for Git LFS optimization
- JSON output mode

---

## Common Features Across All Apps

### Cross-Platform Support
All three apps support:
- macOS (amd64 and arm64)
- Linux (amd64 and arm64)
- Windows WSL (via Linux compatibility)

### Development Standards
- Go 1.21+ required
- Consistent Makefile structure
- Pre-commit hooks support
- Test coverage tracking
- Linting with golangci-lint
- Formatting with gofmt

### Output Modes
- Human-readable table output (default)
- JSON output for automation (`--json` flag)
- Detailed mode for granular information (`--details` flag where applicable)

### Safety Features
- Dry-run by default
- Explicit confirmation required for destructive operations
- Clear reporting of what will be affected
- Error handling that doesn't silently fail

---

## Development and Release Workflow

### Makefile Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `help` | Show all available make targets |
| `all` | Build all applications (default) |
| `dev-cache` | Build dev-cache application only |
| `git-cleaner` | Build git-cleaner application only |
| `bilge-macos` | Build bilge-macos application only |
| `build` | Build all applications |
| `test` | Run tests in all applications |
| `fmt` | Format code in all applications |
| `lint` | Lint all applications |
| `vet` | Run go vet on all applications |
| `goreleaser-check` | Validate GoReleaser configuration |
| `release-dry-run` | Test GoReleaser without building/publishing |
| `release-snapshot` | Build snapshot release locally (no git tag required) |
| `clean` | Clean all applications and build artifacts |

### Testing a Release Locally

Before creating an actual release, you can test the entire build process:

```bash
# Verify GoReleaser configuration
make goreleaser-check

# Build a local snapshot (no git tag required)
make release-snapshot

# Artifacts will be in ./dist/
# - Individual binaries: dev-cache-darwin-amd64, etc.
# - Homebrew tarball: bilge-VERSION-darwin-{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz
# - Homebrew cask: dist/homebrew/Casks/bilge.rb
```

### Creating a Release

1. **Ensure all changes are committed and pushed**
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare release v1.0.0"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create and push a version tag**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Validates GoReleaser configuration
   - Builds all 6 binaries (3 apps × 2 architectures)
   - Creates GitHub release with:
     - Individual binaries for direct download
     - Combined tarballs for Homebrew
     - Checksums for verification
     - Auto-generated changelog
   - Updates the Homebrew cask in `everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump`
   - Commits cask changes with proper checksums

4. **Verify the release:**
   - Check GitHub Releases: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/releases
   - Check Homebrew cask: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump/tree/main/Casks
   - Trust and test installation:
     ```bash
     brew trust --cask everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/bilge
     brew upgrade --cask bilge
     ```

### Troubleshooting Releases

**Cask not found after release:**

If `brew install bilge` fails with "No available cask":

1. Check that the cask was pushed to the tap:
   - Visit: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump/tree/main/Casks
   - You should see `bilge.rb`

2. Update Homebrew and retry:
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew tap everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump
   brew trust --cask everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/bilge
   brew install --cask bilge
   ```

**Token errors in GitHub Actions:**

If you see authentication errors in the release workflow:

1. Verify the secret exists:
   - Go to: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/settings/secrets/actions
   - Look for `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`

2. Verify the token has the correct permissions:
   - It needs `public_repo` scope
   - It must not be expired

3. Regenerate the token if needed and update the secret

**Checksum mismatches:**

If users report checksum errors:

1. The cask might be out of sync with the release
2. Re-run the release workflow or manually update checksums
3. Check that GoReleaser successfully updated the tap
4. Verify the cask at: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump/tree/main/Casks

### GoReleaser Configuration

The project uses GoReleaser for automated releases with the following configuration:

**Builds:**
- 3 separate builds (one per application)
- Each build specifies `dir` to point to the app directory
- Main file is `./main.go` relative to the app directory
- CGO is disabled for static binaries
- Targets darwin/amd64 and darwin/arm64

**Archives:**
- Individual binaries for direct download (format: `{app}-darwin-{arch}`)
- Combined tarball for Homebrew (format: `bilge-{version}-darwin-{arch}.tar.gz`)
- The tarball includes all three binaries

**Homebrew Integration:**
- Automatically generates a cask in `everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump`
- The cask installs all three binaries
- Includes caveats with quick start instructions
- Includes version tests for all binaries

**Changelog:**
- Auto-generated from Git commits
- Grouped by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Performance, etc.)
- Excludes internal changes (docs, tests, ci)

### Distribution Strategy

**Primary: Homebrew (Recommended)**
```bash
brew tap everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump
brew trust --cask everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/bilge
brew install --cask bilge
```
Run the trust command before installing or upgrading this third-party cask.

Benefits:
- Automatic PATH configuration
- Easy updates via `brew upgrade`
- No sudo required
- Standard for macOS users
- Handles dependencies automatically

**Secondary: Direct Download**
```bash
# Via install script (requires -b flag)
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/HEAD/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $HOME/.local/bin

# Or download binaries directly from GitHub Releases
# https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/releases
```

**install.sh Behavior:**
- Requires `-b` flag to specify installation directory
- Errors if Homebrew is detected (recommends using `brew install`)
- Downloads pre-built binaries from GitHub Releases
- Supports version selection
- Supports individual app installation with `-a` flag

### Required Setup for Maintainers

To enable automated Homebrew releases:

1. **Create tap repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `homebrew-bilge-pump` (must start with `homebrew-`)
   - Description: "Homebrew tap for bilge tools"
   - Visibility: Public
   - Initialize with README
   - After creation, clone and create `Casks/` directory:
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:everydaydevopsio/homebrew-bilge-pump.git
     cd homebrew-bilge-pump
     mkdir Casks
     git add Casks
     git commit -m "Add Casks directory"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Configure GitHub token:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   - Note: "GoReleaser Homebrew Tap"
   - Expiration: Choose appropriate expiration
   - Scopes: Select `public_repo` (allows read/write to public repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
   - Add as repository secret in the bilge repository:
     - Go to: https://github.com/everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/settings/secrets/actions
     - Click "New repository secret"
     - Name: `HOMEBREW_TAP_GITHUB_TOKEN`
     - Value: Paste the token you copied
     - Click "Add secret"

3. **Verify workflow:**
   - GitHub Actions workflow is in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - Uses `goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v6`
   - Requires Go 1.22.x

4. **Test after first release:**
   ```bash
   # Add the tap and install
   brew tap everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump
   brew trust --cask everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump/bilge
   brew install --cask bilge --verbose

   # Verify all binaries are installed
   which dev-cache
   which git-cleaner
   which bilge-macos

   # Test functionality
   dev-cache --version
   git-cleaner --version
   bilge-macos --version

   # Audit the cask
   brew audit --strict --online bilge

   # Test uninstall (optional)
   brew uninstall bilge
   brew untap everydaydevopsio/bilge-pump
   ```

### Future: Migrating to Homebrew Core

Once the cask is stable and has users, the project can be submitted to homebrew-core for wider distribution:

1. Review the [Homebrew contribution guidelines](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request)
2. Ensure the cask passes `brew audit --strict --online`
3. Submit a PR to [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core)
4. After acceptance, users can install with just:
   ```bash
   brew install bilge
   ```
   (no tap required)
